With this system you will be able to control your home light, Air conditioning, TV, water heater any many more devices (IR, wall sockets, and light switches are only a few). The system is Arduino and Raspberry Pi based. You will be able to control your house from the internal WiFi network as well as from the Internet For internet access you will have to use a DSN service such as no-ip You can have multiple Arduino stations controlling anything at you home from your phone, iPad or Desktop(currently using a web page only). Installing the framework @ your home Installing this framework will require knowledge with Basic electronics, soldering. Installing the light switch control stations will require in experience with High voltage 220V/120V circuits . If you do not know how to handle High Voltage, please do not! . But the good news you can still use The IR stations to control AC, TV and such. The Arduino stations should be flashed with the attached custom Bootloader to enable remote upload of sketches from your development computer via RF24 (instead of tearing the wall apart each time) also know as OTA (Over the Air update). Controlling you home is done via your phone browser or any other browser throw a wep application. The web application is hosted on a Raspberry Pi station, running nodejs. nodejs 'talks' to a serial bluetooth attached to the Raspberry Pi GPIOs the Serial Bluetooth sends the data to an arduino station gateway which dispatches the messages to the relevant Arduino endPoint station using RF24 module. each endpoint station has a unique address and a set of command it knows to handle. This Project is managed with trello The code is managed and developed using Visual Studio Code Multi-root Workspaces and platform.io This combination allows to develop the server side (and sync update using ssh) and the arduino station, including the bootloader code, compilation and flashing, all in one place. It also offers tasks to compile and flash the bootloader and even a predefined theme. platform.io also allowed my to have a common networking code for all Arduino station in one common directory which all Arduino projects (stations) can reference, keeping the protocol update changes easy and safe. If you are a developer and would like to contribute to the code Checkout the documentation here if you are a user wishing to use the platform at your own hose Checkout the documentation here","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome-to-smarthomediy","text":"This project is a DIY home automation framework.
